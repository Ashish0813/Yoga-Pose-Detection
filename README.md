# Yoga-Pose-Detection
This project involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for video and image processing to detect and classify yoga poses. In this project, we used a white background for videos input and captured the complete body for pose detection. This system will detect a minor mistake in the userâ€™s pose and provide advice on how to correct them.
